Materialized views are often used for improving query performance in read-heavy environments.', '- DELETE: Deletes rows from a table based on specified conditions, and it can be rolled back using a transaction. DELETE statement removes individual rows and fires associated triggers. - TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table and resets identity columns (if any) without firing triggers. TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE as it deallocates the data pages used by the table, but it cannot be rolled back, and it does not trigger DELETE triggers.', '- DISTINCT: Removes duplicate rows from the result set of a SELECT query, returning only unique rows. It operates on all columns in the result set. - GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values in one or more columns into summary rows, allowing aggregate functions to be applied to each group. It divides the result set into groups based on specified column(s) and applies aggregate functions independently to each group. GROUP BY is commonly used for summarizing data and calculating aggregates.', '- INNER JOIN: Returns rows from both tables that have matching values in the specified column(s) of the joined tables. It filters out rows that do not have matching values and returns only the intersection of rows from both tables. - OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from one or both tables in the join, including rows that do not have matching values in the specified column(s) of the joined tables. OUTER JOIN includes rows from one table even if there are no corresponding matches in the other table, and it can be further categorized into LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN based on the inclusion of non-matching rows from the left, right, or both tables.', '- LIKE function: Searches for a specified pattern within a string and returns true if the pattern is found, using wildcard characters such as \"%\" (matches any string of zero or more characters) and \"_\" (matches any single character). LIKE is commonly used for pattern matching in SQL queries. - SUBSTRING function: Extracts a substring from a string based on specified starting position and length, returning a portion of the original string. SUBSTRING is used to manipulate string data by extracting substrings or portions of text.', '- UNION: Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set, removing duplicate rows. UNION performs a distinct operation to eliminate duplicate rows from the final result set. - UNION ALL: Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set without removing duplicate rows. UNION ALL does not perform any duplicate removal and includes all rows from each query result.', 'The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns into summary rows.

It arranges rows in the specified order before returning the result set to the user. ORDER BY is commonly used to organize query results for presentation or to retrieve the top or bottom N rows based on certain criteria.', 'The SQL EXISTS operator is used to test whether a subquery returns any rows. It returns true if the subquery returns at least one row, and false if the subquery returns no rows. EXISTS operator is often used with correlated subqueries to check for the existence of matching rows in a related table, allowing users to filter or conditionally execute SQL statements based on the result of the subquery. EXISTS operator is commonly used in WHERE clauses, EXISTS predicates, and conditional expressions to perform data validation, existence checks, or conditional logic in SQL queries.', 'The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter rows from a table based on specified conditions or criteria. It allows users to select rows that meet certain criteria and exclude rows that do not match the conditions. WHERE clause can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statements to perform data retrieval, modification, or deletion operations.

It is beneficial when there are multiple handlers for a request, and the client is unaware of which handler will handle the request.', \"The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the subject (or observable) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them of state changes. This allows objects to be loosely coupled, as the subject doesn't need to know the specific details of its observers.\", 'The Interpreter pattern defines a grammar for interpreting language expressions and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language. It is used in language processing applications, such as compilers or natural language processing, to evaluate expressions or sentences.', 'The Visitor pattern allows you to define operations on an object structure without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

This promotes a decoupled and flexible architecture for event handling.', 'The Mediator pattern defines an object that centralizes communication between objects, preventing them from directly interacting with each other. It addresses the issue of tight coupling between objects by promoting a more structured and controlled way of communication through a mediator object.', 'The Proxy pattern can be used to implement lazy loading by creating a proxy object that acts as a stand-in for another object. When the real object is required, the proxy loads it. Lazy loading is beneficial for improving performance and resource utilization in scenarios where not all object data needs to be loaded upfront.', 'The Null Object pattern provides an object as a surrogate for the absence of an object of a given value. It allows for the handling of null references without explicit checks, promoting more robust and maintainable code. It is useful when you want to avoid null checks and provide default behaviors for absent objects.', 'The Command pattern is instrumental in implementing macros by encapsulating a series of commands into a single command object. This object can then be executed as a single operation, allowing for the recording and playback of a sequence of actions, characteristic of macro functionality.', 'The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It achieves this by representing different states as separate classes and allowing the object to switch between these classes dynamically. This promotes a more modular and extensible way to manage object behavior based on state changes.', 'The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is related to the Factory Method pattern, as both involve object creation, but the Abstract Factory deals with creating families of objects, whereas the Factory Method focuses on creating a single object.', 'Java achieves platform independence through its bytecode which can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.', 'Key features of Java include platform independence, object-oriented nature, strong memory management, built-in support for multithreading, and a rich standard library.', 'The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.', 'The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit that provides tools for developing Java applications.', 'The == operator checks for reference equality, whereas the .equals() method checks for content equality in Java objects.', 'Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, variables, methods, and constructors in Java.
